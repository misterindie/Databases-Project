# Databases-Project
SQL files for DB Design and Development Project

## Project Description

This project consisted of designing and creating a relational database using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

We were then given a list of questions we had to answer. These questions required us to extract, transform, and load data 
within the table.
